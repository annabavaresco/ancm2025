    "## Tips\n",
    "* **Don't panic if you can't test SOTA models** Unfortunately, SOTA AI models are quite computationally intensive to run, and most often don't fit with the Colab free-tier compute budget. The good news is that using large, SOTA models is not necessarily the main goal of cognitive modelling. In fact, using \"older\" models may even be a preferable option, because you can interpret results leveraging existing interpretability and cognitive-modelling studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If brain responses are too complex to work with, go for behavioural data** Most of the studies mentioend above use brain data, which is extremely exciting (but also painful) to work with. If you struggle to work with brain data (too large, not preprocessed, badly documented), try to use behavoural data, such as reaction times (RTs) or similarity judgments—they are usually easier to work with and often less noisy than neural data.\n"
