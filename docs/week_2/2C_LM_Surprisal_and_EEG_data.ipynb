        "Today we'll be working on the EEG data collected by _[Broderick et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982218301465)_ while participants were listening to an audiobook. The authors were interested in the N400 component of event-related potentials.\n",
        "\n",
        "What's special about N400? It has consistently been shown to signal _surprisal_, which can roughly be defined as 'incongruence with the surrounding context'. To illustrate, if we read a sentence broccoli with a word that is completely out of context -- and therefore _surprising_ -- our brains will signal this with a spike in the N400 component.\n",
        "\n",
        "Broderick and colleagues, however, move away from this incongrous word paradigm and look at words during natural speech comprehension more in general. In particular, they ivestigate whether N400 is tracking the contextual semantic content of words while they are being processed. How do they do this? They construct word vectors representing how semantically dissimilar a word is to the preceding context, and then regress these vectors against EEG data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's briefly zoom in into how the authors computed these 'dissimilarity vectors'. Let's consider the sentence \"Mary saw the dog as she walked past the garden\" (this is a made-up example for illustration purposes). If we want to compute the dissimilarity vector for a word -- let's say 'dog' -- as the authors did, we should first compute word embeddings for all the words in the sentence using word2vec and then do the following:\n",
        "1. Select the word embedding corresponding to 'dog'\n",
        "2. Compute the average of the word embeddings from all the words preceding 'dog' (so here 'Mary', 'saw', 'the')\n",
        "3. Compute the Pearson correlation between the 'dog' vector and the average vector (form point 2)\n",
        "4. Subtract the correlation from 1 (because we're trying to compute _dissimilarity_ and not _similarity_)\n",
        "\n",
        "This semantic dissimilarity measure can be considered as a 'representation of the meaning added to a sentence by that word'.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll look at how these vectors are used to learn us something about EEG responses later on in this notebook. For now, let's focus on _semantic dissimilarity_ and how it was operationalised by Broderick and colleagues.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**QUESTION 1**\n",
        "Are there are any shortcomings with using word2vec vectors? Do you think that the contextualised vectors that we can get from more recent language models might be more suitable for the purpose? (⚠️_Spoiler alert:_ all these rhetorical questions seem to presuppose a 'yes')"

The first letter refers to the brain lobe where the electrode is positioned (F for _frontal_, C for _central_, P for _parietal_). The second letter Z stands for 'zero' and indicates that the electrodes are placed on the midline sagittal plane of the skull. But why are we only looking at the Z-positioned electrodes and not at the other ones? The Z electrodes are often used as a point of reference."

        "a) Study the temporal response functions you've just plotted for Broderick's model of word surprisal versus the BERT-based model (with 4 words prior context). Do you observe the N400 component (negative polarization approximately 400 ms after word onset) in some of the channels? Do you observe this polarisation for the same channels across models? Do you find differences between the two models?\n",
        "\n",
        "b ) Now consider the results you get with a model that simply assigns uniform surprisal values to all words (i.e., it does not distinguish between suprising or unsurpring words). You can find the data for this model in the `static_100000.npy` file. Does that model change your assessment of the performance of the Broderick and BERT models?\n",
